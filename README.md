# Project 3 - Where I Am

In this project, you will learn to utilize ROS AMCL package to accurately localize a mobile robot inside a map in the Gazebo simulation environments.
Over the course of this lesson, you will learn several aspects of robotic software engineering with a focus on ROS:

Create a ROS package that launches a custom robot model in a custom Gazebo world
Utilize the ROS AMCL package and the Tele-Operation / Navigation Stack to localize the robot
Explore, add, and tune specific parameters corresponding to each package to achieve the best possible localization results

## Video:

Here is the video where it is hsow how the localization performes.
